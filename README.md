# Codespaces: Node Project

Welcome to Node codespace!

The ideia here is to create a centralized setup with the latest tools â€” you just clone and you have a blank canvas setted up to start coding.

Maybe one branch for each environment? Something like `express-ts`, `express-js`, `fastify-ts`, and so on...

Please, help me by opening issues and pull requests.
